This folder should contain any external libraries required.

In particular it should contain the
    Java Advanced Imaging I/O tools library
Download and unpack into this folder the appropriate version for your 
architecture or operating system from:
    http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=Java_Advanced_Imaging_ImageIO_Tools

Do not add the resulting library to GitHub as different developers will require
different versions of the library depending on their architecture and operating
system

In Eclipse, select all the jar files (not the .so files)  in lib, then:
    right click|Build Path|Add to Build Path
