sample_css.tgz should be extracted into the current folder but the extracted
directory hierarchy should NOT be added to GitHub.


To read and write TIFF images (.tif files) in Java, you need to use Java
Advanced Imaging I/O Tools library. This is available from:
    http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=Java_Advanced_Imaging_ImageIO_Tools
Get the download appropriate for your architecture and operating system  and
add the files to your project library. For 64 bit Linux, this includes 
two jar files and a ".so" file. These libraries should not be added to GitHub as
different developers will need different versions based on their architecture
and operating system.


sample.tif is a tiff image file that contains 5 tiff monochrome images.

sample_css contains a directory structure that has a "moments.csv" file with
information about every connected component in the sample.tif images as well as
a small tiff image of every connected component. These small tiff images have
the foreground as black and the background as 100% transparent rather than just
white. This means that, even if the bound boxes of the connected components
overlap each other on the original image, if they are drawn on a white canvas,
they will reconstruct the original image correctly: i.e. the white background of
one connected component will not overwrite the black foreground of a different
connected component that was drawn previously.
